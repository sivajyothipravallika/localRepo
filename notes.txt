What is Python?
Python is an interpreted programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Python is known for its simplicity and readability, which makes it a great language for beginners.

What is an interpreted programming language?
An interpreted programming language is different from a compiled language.

In a compiled language, the code is translated into machine code before it is run.

In an interpreted language, the code is executed line by line by an interpreter, usually written in another language.
This makes it easier to write and test code, but it can be slower than compiled languages.

What is a script?
A script is a file that contains a series of commands that are executed by a computer. 
Scripts are often used to automate repetitive tasks, such as renaming files, moving files, or processing data. 
Python is often used to write scripts because of its simplicity and readability.

Technically, any program that is written in a scripting language is a script. 
However, the term is often used to refer to small programs that automate tasks on a computer. 
The terms "scripting language" and "interpreted language" are often used interchangeably. 
They are technically different, but the distinction is rarely important.
